# Pathfinding-Visualizer
A path finding visualizer using the A-star algorithm and pygame library.

This application is a visualizer that utilizes the A-star algorithm to display a path between two points. This program was built to further understand algorithms such as the A-star and their implementations as well as to further practice python. 

Credits:
This program was made through following the tutorial by Tech with Tim and thus the only purpose in creating this was learning. 

Installation Steps:
Download pygame
